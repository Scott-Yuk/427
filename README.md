## Update 6/13/2023

### Progress

Currently the website has had some UI improvements from the basic template used. Implementation of Google Recaptcha is in progress, with the recaptcha being a step for registering but the full functionality is still in progress. Security implementation is also in progress with clean coding and low risk of coding vulnerabilities with the use of ESLint and JSLint.

### Progress

A somewhat working version of the website is able to run, but a lot of ideas are still in the development stage. As a few functions are not as well developed as we want them to be, the basic functionality is up and running.

### Techinical Notes
Use and install steps for this program can be found in the wiki Linked below.

### Closing Thoughts
Overall within the short time given to create a functioning program a lot has been done. Having to sacrifce certain aspects of the website to put more focus on others was a struggle within the group but overall a working project was created. Although more security functionality could've been implemented within our program, due to the time restrain not all ideas could be implemented. With our final release we where able to creating a working program and learned a lot of security precaustions that should be thought of for programmers. Although implementation wasn't fully done, the learning and expirence was valuable.
